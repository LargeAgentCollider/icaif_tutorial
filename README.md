# Tutorial on Differentiable Probabilistic Programming for Agent-Based Models [ICAIF 2024]

Welcome to the tutorial on differentiable agent-based models!

# Description

This tutorial will introduce a new paradigm for agent-based models (ABMs) that leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to efficiently compute the simulator's gradients. The tutorial will cover:

1. An overview of vanilla AD and AD methods to differentiate through discrete stochastic programs.
2. Examples of differentiable ABMs with millions of agents used to study disease spread across multiple countries.
3. State-of-the-art methods for simulating, calibrating, and analyzing differentiable ABMs.
4. Integration of differentiable ABMs into probabilistic programming pipelines.
5. Applications of AD for generating synthetic populations.


# Target audience

The tutorial is aimed at the thos in the ICAIF community who share an interest on agent-based modelling and how to make it deployable to the real world at scale.
