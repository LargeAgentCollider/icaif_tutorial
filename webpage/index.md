# Tutorial on Differentiable Probabilistic Programming for Agent-Based Models [ICAIF 2024]

Welcome to the tutorial on differentiable agent-based models!

# Description

This tutorial will introduce a new paradigm for agent-based models (ABMs) that leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to efficiently compute simulator gradients. In particular, this tutorial will provide:

1. An overview of vanilla AD and AD methods to differentiate through discrete stochastic programs.
2. A walkthrough on how to build a differentiable economic ABM.
3. State-of-the-art methods for calibrating differentiable ABMs.

# Target audience

The tutorial is aimed at members of the ICAIF community who are interested in the deployment, calibration and analysis of large-scale agent-based models. No previous experience with automatic differentiation will be required to understand the tutorial material.
